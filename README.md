âš¡ Parallel Algorithms & Data Structures

This repository contains my coursework and projects for **Parallel Programming**, re-framed to highlight **DSA fundamentals with parallel execution**.  
Assignments include implementations of **sorting, searching, and pipeline processing** algorithms in C/C*, focusing on:

- ðŸ”¹ Algorithmic efficiency & speedup analysis  
- ðŸ”¹ Concurrency & parallelism (multiple processes)  
- ðŸ”¹ Real-world system design analogies (e.g., pipelines, stream aggregation)  

By organizing these assignments into **DSA categories** (Sorting, Searching, Aggregation), this repo demonstrates both my understanding of **core algorithms** and my ability to extend them into **scalable, system-level solutions**.
